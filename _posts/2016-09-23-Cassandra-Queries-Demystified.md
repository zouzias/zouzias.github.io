In this post, we give an overview of Cassandra's query language. Cassandra's data modelling is probably one of the toughest tasks that a data scientist might face. The root of it lies on the fact that Cassandra's WHERE, WHERE X IN () etc queries are restricted to the definition of the primary key.

## Primary Key


## Partition key

## Clustering Key
